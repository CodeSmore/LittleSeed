# LittleSeed
A look at some of the projects I worked on at <a href="https://littleseed.io/">LittleSeed</a>. I'm just showing off a little bit of what I helped build :D

## VARIAT Sim

VARIAT is an educational application funded by Medicaid. Its goal is to train medical professionals to recognize implicit bias in their work environment and strategies avoid unconscious pitfalls in order to provide the best care possible.

It was created with Unity3D, utilizing the earliest version of AR Foundation for Augmented Reality, Unity's GUI (uGUI), content driven by plain-text input files, custom Humanoid Animations, Baked Lighting, 3D models for Characters & Environments, Data Collection using Firebase and Google BigQuery, Custom Quizes to track learning at the end of each Act & Module, Direction to resources and Email alerts to track activity, among other things.

### Simulations

A core feature of the application is to teach and encourage empathy through simulation. Note the dialogue system, character animations, and varying scenarios.

### Cited Statistics and Data

VARIAT provides data with sources to educate the user with research rather than hearsay. The information is tied to the interaction the precedes and/or follows it.

A unique blend of Unity's GUI (uGUI) and plain-text input are utilized to allow for fast and easy changes and additions for every piece of text seen in the app.

### Augmented Reality

VARIAT sim utilizes a combination of AR & VR to enable unique viewpoints when looking at a problem. 

These experiences utilize Unity's AR Foundation when it was still in it's version 1.0 experimental state. They use markerless placement, plane detection, active scaling & position changes, and many of the core features found in Unity.

How do you make the right decisions when time and money are limited?

How can we make patients feel more welcome and at-ease with decorations and aesthetics?

### Learning Opportunities

Quizes are used to test the user's knowledge <b>BEFORE</b> and <b>AFTER</b> points of learning. Medical Professionals can even acquire Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits if they test well in the APPLY section at the end of each Module!

## Voyager (Previously VoxelBay)

<b>VoxelBay</b> is just one part of an initiative to provide pain and anxiety relief in clinics. <b>Voyager</b> is the next step in reaching that goal by providing an immersive experience full of exploration, games, and colorful characters.

Voyager is separated into 4 main parts:

### The Hub

Here the user sails about the islands, interacts with seas life and characters, and helps troubled inhabitants through mini-games.

I worked to fix a few egregious bugs in the boat nav system, the loading of levels, and a couple inefficiencies. 

### Crab Game

<img src="https://github.com/CodeSmore/LittleSeed/blob/main/Images/Crab%20Game.png" width="800">

The seagulls are causing a ruckus! Help the crabs get rid of these troublemakers.

My work in this was quite limited. I assisted the creator to make QOL (quality of life) changes to create a consistent experience.

### Underwater Game

<img src="https://github.com/CodeSmore/LittleSeed/blob/main/Images/Underwater%20Game.png" width="800">

The ocean floor is full of mystery and...treasure!? See what you can find.

Here's one where I created the many elements, including movement through the world, camera sway corrections, interactions with elements on the seabed, and the systems that connect them.

### Dragon Game

<img src="https://github.com/CodeSmore/LittleSeed/blob/main/Images/Dragon%20Game.png" width="800">

A party is going to start at sundown, but the guests are having trouble navigating the waters! Help the dragon light the torches so the ships can safely arrive.

Similar to the Underwater level, in this game, I worked on the movement, the rules of the game, and all the moving parts!
