# LittleSeed
A look at some of the projects I worked on a LittleSeed. I'm just showing off a little bit of what I helped build :D

## VARIAT Sim

VARIAT is an educational application funded by Medicaid. Its goal is to train medical professionals to recognize implicit bias in their work environment and strategies avoid unconscious pitfalls in order to provide the best care possible.

It was created with Unity3D, utilizing the earliest version of AR Foundation for Augmented Reality, Unity's GUI (uGUI), content driven by plain-text input files, custom Humanoid Animations, Baked Lighting, 3D models for Characters & Environments, Data Collection using Firebase and Google BigQuery, Custom Quizes to track learning at the end of each Act & Module, Direction to resources and Email alerts to track activity, among other things.

### Simulations

A core feature of the application is to teach and encourage empathy through simulation. Note the dialogue system, character animations, and varying scenarios.

### Cited Statistics and Data

VARIAT provides data with sources to educate the user with research rather than hearsay. The information is tied to the interaction the precedes and/or follows it.

A unique blend of Unity's GUI (uGUI) and plain-text input are utilized to allow for fast and easy changes and additions for every piece of text seen in the app.

### Augmented Reality

VARIAT sim utilizes a combination of AR & VR to enable unique viewpoints when looking at a problem. 

These experiences utilize Unity's AR Foundation when it was still in it's version 1.0 experimental state. They use markerless placement, plane detection, active scaling & position changes, and many of the core features found in Unity.

How do you make the right decisions when time and money are limited?

How can we make patients feel more welcome and at-ease with decorations and aesthetics?

### Learning Opportunities

Quizes are used to test the user's knowledge <b>BEFORE</b> and <b>AFTER</b> points of learning. Medical Professionals can even acquire Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits if they test well in the APPLY section at the end of each Module!

## Voyager (Previously VoxelBay)

<b>VoxelBay</b> (link to text) is just one part of an initiative to provide pain and anxiety relief in clinics. <b>Voyager</b> is the next step in reaching that goal.
